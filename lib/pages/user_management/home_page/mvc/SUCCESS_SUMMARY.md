## 🛠️ **Changes Implemented**

### **1. HomePageMVCWidget Updated** ✅

- Added `onTour` parameter support for full compatibility
- Updated route names to match original (`HomePage`, `/homePage`)
- Maintained identical functionality

### **2. Navigation Routes Updated** ✅

- `flutter_flow/nav/nav.dart`: Now uses `HomePageMVCWidget`
- `main.dart`: NavBarPage updated to use MVC widget
- All existing navigation paths preserved

### **3. Import Management** ✅

- Added necessary imports for MVC widget
- Cleaned up unused imports
- No breaking changes to existing code

### **4. Backward Compatibility** ✅

- Same route names and paths
- Same parameters and functionality
- All existing navigation code works unchanged

## 🎯 **Architecture Benefits Achieved**

### **MVC Separation** 🏗️

- **Models**: Clean data management (`HomePageDataModel`, `HomePageUIModels`)
- **Views**: Modular UI components (Header, Navigation, Marketplace, Tasks)
- **Controllers**: Business logic coordination (`HomePageController`)
- **Services**: Domain-specific operations (Task, User, Marketplace services)
- **Repositories**: Unified data access layer

### **Component Structure** 📦

```
✅ HomePageView (main orchestrator)
├── ✅ HomePageHeader (user info, settings)
├── ✅ NavigationButtons (Ask Sage, Messages)
├── ✅ MarketplaceSection (product listings)
└── ✅ TasksSection (garden & plant tasks)
```

### **Data Flow** 🔄

```
User Interaction → View → Controller → Repository → Services → Backend
                  ↑                                              ↓
                  ← ← ← ← Model ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
```
