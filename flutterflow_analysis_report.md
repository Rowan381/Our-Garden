## Custom Code

- **Custom Actions:**
  - `lib/custom_code/actions/` contains `new_custom_action.dart`, `new_custom_action2.dart`, and `index.dart` (minimal, likely FlutterFlow custom actions)
- **Custom Functions:**
  - `lib/flutter_flow/custom_functions.dart` contains utility functions for geolocation, price formatting, filtering, etc.
- **Other Custom Code:**
  - Some custom logic in `lib/app_state.dart` (e.g., OpenAI/Kindwise API keys, persisted state)

## Screens/Pages & Structure

- **Pages Directory:** `lib/pages/` is organized by feature (e.g., `chat_groupwbubbles`, `garden_management`, `marketplace`, `user_management`, `gpt`)
- **Each feature** contains subfolders for each screen, with a `*_widget.dart` (UI) and `*_model.dart` (logic/state)
- **Example Pages:**
  - `chat_groupwbubbles/chat_2_details/chat2_details_widget.dart` (chat details)
  - `garden_management/add_garden/add_garden_widget.dart` (add garden)
  - `marketplace/listing_details/listing_details_widget.dart` (listing details)
  - `user_management/home_page/home_page_widget.dart` (home page)
- **Navigation:**
  - Uses `go_router` with routes defined in `lib/flutter_flow/nav/nav.dart`
  - Routes are named and mapped to widgets, with support for async params (Firestore docs)
  - Main navigation via `NavBarPage` (bottom navigation bar)

## Widgets & Components

- **Custom Widgets:**
  - `lib/components/` contains reusable widgets (e.g., tour widgets, skip tour, etc.)
- **FlutterFlow Widgets:**
  - `lib/flutter_flow/` contains generated widgets (e.g., `flutter_flow_widgets.dart`, `flutter_flow_drop_down.dart`, etc.)
- **Custom Functions:**
  - `lib/flutter_flow/custom_functions.dart` (see above)

## Firebase Integrations

- **Firebase Core:** `lib/backend/firebase/firebase_config.dart` initializes Firebase
- **Auth:** `lib/auth/firebase_auth/` (email, Google, Apple, anonymous)
- **Firestore:** Data models in `lib/backend/schema/` (e.g., `users_record.dart`, `plants_record.dart`)
- **Cloud Functions:** `lib/backend/cloud_functions/cloud_functions.dart` (minimal, likely for API calls)
- **Storage:** `lib/backend/firebase_storage/storage.dart`
- **Messaging:** `lib/backend/push_notifications/`
- **Performance:** Included in dependencies

## Backend/API Usage

- **API Calls:**
  - `lib/backend/api_requests/api_calls.dart` contains classes for Stripe, KindWise (plant ID), and other APIs
  - Hardcoded endpoints for Stripe, KindWise, Geoapify, etc.
- **Custom Backend:** Minimal, mostly via Firebase and 3rd-party APIs

## AdMob Integration

- **No AdMob integration found** (no references to AdMob in codebase)

## Third-Party Services

- **Stripe:** Payments
- **KindWise:** Plant identification (API key in app_state.dart)
- **OpenAI:** API key in app_state.dart
- **Google Maps/Places:** API keys in various files, place picker widgets
- **Geoapify:** Used for geocoding
- **Other:** Mapbox, image diagnosis, analytics (Firebase)

## State Management Approach

- **Provider:** Used for global app state (`FFAppState` in `app_state.dart`)
- **ChangeNotifier:** Used for stateful models and app state
- **No BLoC, GetX, or Riverpod** found

## Navigation Approach

- **go_router:** Named routes, async params, bottom navigation bar
- **No Navigator 2.0 custom logic** (relies on go_router abstraction)

## Limitations & Missing Parts

- **Tight Coupling:**
  - Heavy use of `FFAppState`, `FFRoute`, and `FFParameters` (FlutterFlow conventions)
  - Data models and navigation are tightly coupled to FlutterFlow structure
- **Scalability Issues:**
  - Large widget files (e.g., 2,000+ lines for some pages)
  - Logic and UI often mixed in widget files
- **Technical Debt:**
  - FlutterFlow-generated code is verbose and not always idiomatic Flutter
  - Custom code is minimal and often isolated
- **No AdMob/Rewarded Ads:** Not present
- **No Custom Backend Logic:** All backend handled via Firebase or 3rd-party APIs
- **Hardcoded Values:**
  - API keys for OpenAI, KindWise, Google Maps, Geoapify found in code (security risk)
  - Some test data and default values present

## Modularity & Reusability

- **Modularity:**
  - Some modularity in custom functions and actions
  - Most business logic is embedded in large widget files
- **Reusability:**
  - Custom functions and actions can be reused
  - Most UI and navigation code is tightly coupled to FlutterFlow structure and would need refactoring

## Separation of Concerns

- **UI vs Logic:**
  - Some separation via `*_model.dart` files, but logic often mixed with UI
  - Global state in `FFAppState`, but many widgets manage their own state
- **Scalability:**
  - Large files and tight coupling make scaling and maintenance harder

## Recommendations for Migration

- **Reusable Code:**
  - Custom functions, actions, and some models can be reused with minor refactoring
  - Firebase integration code can be adapted
- **Needs Rewrite:**
  - Most UI code, navigation, and state management should be rewritten for a custom Flutter project
  - Refactor to use idiomatic Flutter patterns (e.g., BLoC, Riverpod, modular widgets)
- **Security:**
  - Move API keys and sensitive data to secure storage or environment variables
- **Separation:**
  - Separate business logic from UI, use smaller widgets and providers

## Reimporting to FlutterFlow

- **Warning:**
  - Modifying the codebase outside FlutterFlow may break reimporting or future exports
  - Custom code and refactored structure may not be compatible with FlutterFlow's code generator
